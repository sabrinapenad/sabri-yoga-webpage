      <div class="paragraph-banner-item">On my classes, all levels are welcomed. They are usually between
      60 and 90 minutes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph-banner-item">As a teacher, my goal is for my students to create
        a connection with their bodies and their breathing, understanding their limitations and
        working around them. I trasmit all the benefits and the importance of performing
        yoga postures (asanas) without harming and without sacrificing your body, generating
        more strength, flexibility and resistance both mentally and physically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph-banner-item">I really like the spiritual side of yoga practice,
        I am passionate about teaching my students to live yoga inside and outside the mat.
        Usually, my classes begin with a small meditation in which I put a special intention to
        practice, followed by the practice of asanas (multilevel or basic, according to the experience
        of the group), and ending with a relaxation and final reflection.</div>
